# Convex-Hull

Implementing and visualizing algorithms for computing Convex Hulls in the plane.

Tested on JDK 11. Any system with JDK 11 or above should be able to run this program.

Run from a file explorer: find the chtest.jar file, <!-- Change chtest.jar to whatever the final name will be --> right click it, go to properties, and mark as executable. Then in properties, set your version of the JDK as the executing program.

Run from the command line: simply navigate to where chtest.jar is located and type ```java -jar chtest.jar``` and the program should start running.

```Tester.java``` contains a simple program to test runtimes of the different algorithms without having to use the UI.
